Tiny service for DJing using youtube videos


### How to use

First, load 2 youtube videos (just put the url inside the text box and hit load). Both videos will start playing.
Now maximize the volume of one of the videos. You should now have 2 playing videos, one mute and one with 100% volume.
Now click on `Swap` checkboxes for your videos, pick your speed from the bottom panel and click swap. 

You can have up to 6 videos at the same time but you can you only swap 2 of them simultaneously.
